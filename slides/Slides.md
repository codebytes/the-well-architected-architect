# The Azure Well-Architected Framework

The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a design framework that can improve the quality of a workload by helping it to:

- Be resilient, available, and recoverable.
- Be as secure as you need it to be.
- Deliver a sufficient return on investment.
- Support responsible development and operations.
- Accomplish its purpose within acceptable timeframes.
